## Predicting the Probability of the Wining IPL Team

+ IPL data(2008-2020) is available on the kaggle. We get the data from the kaggle.com.

+ Unneccessary features will be removed from the dataset.

+ In dataset, Two teams are only played for one-two years. So we will remove those teams.

+ We will take important features in X and label feature in y.

+ We split data into training and testing dataset.

+ Applying Logistic Regression ML Algorithm on the training dataset.

+ We will predict the data for X_test.

+ And finding the accuracy score of the test data.

+ Here, we need to predict probability of the wining IPL team.

+ We store our model into the pickle file to make WEBAPP.

+ WEBAPP is deployed on Heroku.
